        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a proud son, a skilled software developer, and a dedicated meditation student. My journey with mindfulness and self-discovery began around age 17, when I discovered  Yoga. These lineages of dharma have deeply rooted themselves within me and continue to guide me on my path of self-discovery and growth.<br>

I am fluent in both English and Spanish, allowing me to connect with people from all walks of life. In addition to my technical skills, I have a passion for writing and exploring the confluence of meditation, art, and humor. I am determined to create a path that others can understand and experience directly.<br>

As I continue to grow and evolve, I am committed to using my voice and energy to advocate for social justice and contribute to positive change within my community. I believe in preserving the diversity of cultures and promoting multicultural and intergenerational connections. Through my practice of loving awareness, I aim to nourish these connections and cultivate growth in a meaningful and enlivening way.<br>

          I have a deep passion for the outdoors, and work to provide for the people around me. </p>
