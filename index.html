        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a proud son, a skilled software developer, and a dedicated meditation student. My journey with mindfulness and self-discovery began around age 17, when I discovered  Yoga. These lineages of dharma have deeply rooted themselves within me and continue to guide me on my path of self-discovery and growth.<br>

          </br>I am fluent in both English and Spanish, allowing me to connect with people from all walks of life. In addition to my technical skills, I have a passion for writing and exploring the confluence of meditation, art, and humor. I am determined to create a path that others can understand and experience directly.<br>

          </br>As I continue to grow and evolve, I am committed to using my voice and energy to advocate for social justice and contribute to positive change within my community. I believe in preserving the diversity of cultures and promoting multicultural and intergenerational connections. Through my practice of loving awareness, I aim to nourish these connections and cultivate growth in a meaningful and enlivening way.<br>

          </br>I have a deep passion for the outdoors, and work to provide for the people around me.

          <a href="https://github.com/Crawnicles/Recommend_books">Digital Library</a>
        </h3>
        <p>This project is an ongoing creation of something I wanted to build for personal use to store the books
          I've read and the information I've got from the books. A user may search for books they like or import their book list from Goodreads
          and use their books to find similar books they may like. For future iterations, I'd like to build a frontend to show the book covers and my favorite sections of the books</p>

          <a href="https://github.com/Crawnicles/Algorithmic-Trading-App">Algorithmic Trading Strategy</a>
        </h3>
        <p>We set out to test the Williams % R and the Williams Break-Out Volatility (BOV) strategy on historical market data using python. We will compare the returns of the strategies to see if any outperform the market or the buy and hold strategy.</p>
